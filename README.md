# Development Proccess.

---

First Day :

Mostly spent with research about Flutter and ReactNative. I could've learn Flutter for this submission but I saw the ReactNative Web more beneficial for the company
and this submission.
I didnt want to use cli because of the emulator problems that has with my computer. I'm having problems with running emulators because of the cpu power.
And I've had experiences with Expo before.
For seeing ios part of the app, Expo has a application that I can review in my own personal home while I'm constructing.

- Checked about Flutter
- Trying best workflow for not this job alone but future possible wants.
- Configuring the Development Enviroment.
- Search through GitHub and Dribble Desings for the creative decision making.

---

Second Day :

The workflow has been decided on React Native Web with Expo. At this moment I've started to have the configurations and emulator ready and re-gained the knowledge about
the technologies that I want to use.
The Redux part of this job mostly confused me with decision making because of the current situations with new releases.
I've decided to go safe, and use older release with Expo.

- I've decided the technologies that I want to use. The coding proccess has begun in this day.

Workflow and Technologies that I've decided.

    React Native Web: We'll have a web application along with ios / android. This would fit company more in my idea.
    Mobx: With React Native's Hooks, it can manage the State Management more easily.
    Typescript: As the maing language I would work with.
    React Navigation: For using the screens more changeable with the web and also mobile.
    AsyncStorage: Local storage within the phone. In this way when you close and reopen the app, the data will be stored temporarily. It would beneficial to Offline usage.
    StyledComponants: To have more CSS likeable components that can we modify and customize more.

Version Control

    reactnative: 0.55.4
    reactnativeweb: 0.10.0
    reactart: 16.8.2

---

Third Day :

Workflow has changed in this day.

The Web Hooks are still in development. Watched a conference about it and decided to go on with the Expo normal. The compiled web part of the code doesnt seem to work.

Spent a time with the design and in this time I've decided to go on with Full page design unlike the design you sent me.
Because of the whole page needs to change on each other "Journey", I didnt find it to be best to have different 3 cards that change in everytime we slide to next journey.
Design-vise I've implemented all the parts on just one page.

Started with simple TypeScript Expo application with React Native.

Found some ESLINT configuration from gitHub to make my workflow more easier on Windows.

Created Stack Navigation on MyStatus. ( Status > MyStatus )

on App I return Navigator within a Screen. which is a stack.

Wrote LoadAssets.tsx for avoid flickering and when reloading it excludes some problems.
Wrote Sliders.
Wrote Text with right and left variants.
Wrote Footer details. Left it just text for now.
Wrote Button for the Quickise part.
